#### Zen Cart Support Thread: [https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?74800-Superglobals-Plus&p=478114](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?74800-Superglobals-Plus&p=478114)

Super Globals Plus is a developers' tool that makes evaluating variables easy. It produces a clear overview of the contents of strings, arrays, constants, objects, arrays within object, objects within arrays or whatever.

Because the amount of information given by this tool was overwhelming to most new users of the Super Globals Plus script, version 1.24 and later only shows $_POST and $_SESSION by default.

## Features:
- Show all GLOBALS, or just the Superglobals you need to evaluate.
- Show all defined constants (v1.2).
- Show a list of included files (v1.22).
- Show Superglobals either in a javascript popup window or at the end of each rendered page. (v1.4)
- Optionally hide HTTP_ variables when showing all globals.
- Show the whole content of each variable, including all objects and arrays etc!
- Recursion protection (optional: recursion level/off)
- Show the variable type (array, string, object, integer, NULL, boolean, resource).
- Converts strings into their htmlentities before output (v1.0)
- Clear output (see screenshot below).
- Optional IP address protection.
- Admin switches for all options.
